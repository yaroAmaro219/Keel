          <p class='home-p'>Acting requires two things above all: bravery and honesty. But when the subject is yourself, sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.

            <p class='home-p'>Why do you need a partner? There are many reasons. For one, as all diarists know, there are few things more therapeutic than writing about one’s day. Another I             particularly like is that oftentimes we forget the best things about ourselves. 

            Generally speaking, there are four different outcomes to the ghostwriting process. 

            Collaborating on a full-length memoir. 

            Collaborating on a book proposal (a roughly 40-60 page document with a pitch for literary agents and publishers, an outline consisting of a list of chapters, and a             sample chapter). 

            An article, or a condensed account of your and your family’s life. This makes a marvelous present for an older relative, or a reference for your kids.

            A research collaboration, where you’ll have the resources (for example, the audio files from our interviews and the timeline I’ll build of your life) to write the            memoir yourself. 

            In any and every case, we’ll have a contract so you can stop the project at any time. Of course, any work that we produce together belongs to you.
